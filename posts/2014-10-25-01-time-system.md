Title: Time System

The game design document is going well; however, it seems my estimate of October 26 was rather optimistic. I'm still aiming to complete the document by then, but it may take a few more days. I wanted to share one particular section from the document.

> A time system may at first seem out of place in a game set entirely underground. However, Sub-Terra partially bases dynamic events and enemy encounters on its time system, meaning certain events have a much higher chance of happening during certain times.
>
> For the first three real days of gameplay, including time not spent playing the game, the in-game day cycle is 5 hours and 50 minutes. After the first three real days, the in-game day cycle is calculated based on the average time played per day, discounting days with no time played, and offset slightly to ensure the player has a high chance of experiencing new things each real day.
