Title: Multiplayer

While working on Sub-Terra's game design document, I realized that it would make a lot of sense to add multi-player functionality to the game. Being able to play with others kind of makes sense for this sort of game, and I have no doubt players would want to be able to. This is kind of a big addition, but I'm glad I figured it out at this stage rather than later in the development process.
