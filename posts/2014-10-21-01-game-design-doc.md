Title: Game Design Document

I've started work on Sub-Terra's initial game design document. I've got the structure down so far but it already looks like I'm going to be writing a document of epic proportions. If I want to stick to the project plan, I'll need to get this done by Sunday (October 26), so the next few days are going to be very, very long.
