Title: Game Design Document

It took a lot longer than I expected it to take, but Sub-Terra's game design document is finally complete <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)">apart from appendices</span>! The next step is to complete the technical design document, which will involve engine architecture and class design among other things.
