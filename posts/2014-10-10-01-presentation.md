Title: Presentation

As part of the Computer Games Technology third-year project, I'm required to do a presentation on my initial game concept, the technologies I intend to use to create the game, and any technical difficulties I foresee along with how I intend to overcome them. As such, I've been hard at work this week, but I wanted to share the format in which I plan to present my game idea.

Typically, when you think of presenting something in a university or school context, you think of the first slide being the title slide, containing the project name or description as well as your own name. The second slide tells people what you're going to tell them, and this is followed by actually telling them. In conclusion, you tell them what you've told them and do a brief Q&A session.

I'd like to deviate from this approach and create a presentation more similar in style to those seen at E3 and other games industry conferences, as well as at Apple keynotes. Whilst I want the presentation to be formal, I want to capture the attention of the listeners as soon as (or before) I begin and hold their attention throughout the entire presentation as I keep them in suspense over what I say next.
