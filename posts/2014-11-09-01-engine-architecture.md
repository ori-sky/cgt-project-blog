Title: Runtime Engine Architecture

This week has been a fairly slow one due to other responsibilities at university, but the document outlining Sub-Terra's runtime engine architecture is now complete.

The next stage of the technical design is to create a class diagram of the entire engine. I'm actually going to use Visual Studio 2013 to do this, and I may also begin to implement a basic skeleton of the engine as I work through the design.
