Title: User Interface

Part of Sub-Terra's design document goes into detail about the user interface in the game. I hadn't put a great deal of thought into this, before now, so I went and played a bunch of games in order to figure out exactly what kind of user interface I wanted Sub-Terra to have.

The following snippet isn't necessarily final but I don't foresee any radical changes to it.

> ### Overview
> Sub-Terra opts for a minimal user interface, displaying HUD elements only when relevant to the current gameplay and hiding them at other times to keep the player fully immersed in the game world.
> ### Inventory
> The player has an inventory where they can view all of their tools, weapons, and other items. The inventory is sorted into sections, each of which are sorted alphabetically. From their inventory, the player can equip tools and weapons, and use usable items.
> ### Action Bar
> The action bar is a set of nine item slots that are quickly accessible through the number keys 1 to 9 or the mouse scroll wheel. The bar is normally hidden and becomes visible for a few seconds when the player activates or uses it. Activating the bar makes it temporarily visible and highlights the playerâ€™s equipped item if it is on the bar. The player can add items to the bar through their inventory.
