Title: Saved Games

I just finished writing about saved games in Sub-Terra's game design document. Here's an excerpt from it.

> In Sub-Terra, saved games of the entire world state are stored as a transaction log. While the player is in the game, automatic saves are created frequently of any data that has changed since the last automatic save. The player can create manual saves which store the entire world state in a new checkpoint.
>
> Every time the world is loaded, the most recent world state is loaded by fast-forwarding through the auto saves. A checkpoint is created at this point, followed by the auto saves being deleted to save disk space. This means that auto saves only exist until the next time the world is loaded.
